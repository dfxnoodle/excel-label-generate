# Quick Summary: AR Publication Added & Updates

## What Changed ✅

### Added AR to Frontend
- ✅ New checkbox for **AR (Annual Report)** in publication filter
- ✅ Added AR to publication info modal table
- ✅ Updated example use cases to include AR

### Removed Deprecated References
- ❌ Removed **ARE** (Annual Report English) from documentation
- ❌ Removed **ARC** (Annual Report Chinese) from documentation
- ⚠️ These were deprecated - only **AR** is now used

### Simplified Backend Naming
- Changed: `"Annual Report (English Only)"` → `"Annual Report"`
- Reason: ARE and ARC are deprecated, only AR exists

## Current Publication Codes

**Available in UI:**
1. BE - Bulletin (English Only) ✅
2. BC - Bulletin (Chinese Only) ✅
3. AR - Annual Report ✅ **NEW**

**Available in backend (not in UI yet):**
4. FFE - Facts and Figures (English Only)
5. FFC - Facts and Figures (Chinese Only)

**Removed:**
- ~~BEC~~ - Deprecated (use BE + BC)
- ~~ARE~~ - Deprecated (use AR)
- ~~ARC~~ - Deprecated (use AR)

## For Users

### Before:
- ARE → English annual report
- ARC → Chinese annual report

### After:
- **AR** → Annual report (language-neutral)
- Just check the **AR** checkbox!
